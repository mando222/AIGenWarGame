### Setup Instructions for Mac
1. Make sure you have Python and Flask installed on your machine. If not, you can install them using the package manager Homebrew by running the command `brew install python` and `brew install flask` in the terminal.
2. Download or clone the code from the previous message to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal window, navigate to the directory where you saved the code and run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install any necessary dependencies.
4. Start the server by running the command `python app.py`.
5. You should see a message in the terminal indicating that the server is running on a specific IP and port.
6. You can now test the endpoints using a tool such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) and interact with the server by creating new games, play rounds and check the state of the game.
7. You can also access the endpoints from your browser by typing the appropriate endpoint in the address bar.
8. You should see the response from the server, indicating the status of the game

Please note that, the default configuration runs the server on your localhost and port 5000, you can change the IP and port in the code to suit your needs.
