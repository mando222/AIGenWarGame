# AIGenWarGame
This is an experiment I am running trying to get ChatGPT to build the war card game with a flask backend.  All code and instructions should be generated by the AI and an electron app front end. This section is the only human writen portion.  From this point on everything is 100% AI generated.

### Setup Instructions for Flask App
1. Make sure you have Python and pip (Python package manager) installed on your machine. If not, you can download them from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Clone the code from this repository https://github.com/mando222/AIGenWarGame  to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal window, navigate to the directory where you saved the code and create a new virtual environment by running the command `python -m venv env`
4. activate the virtual environment by running the command  `source env/bin/activate` 
5. Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary dependencies.
6. Start the app by running the command `flask run`.
7. The app will start and will be available at `http://localhost:5000/`.
8. You can test the endpoints using a tool such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) and interact with the server by creating new games, play rounds and check the state of the game.
9. you can change the IP and port in the code to suit your needs.

### Setup Instructions for Electron App
1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (node package manager) installed on your machine. If not, you can download them from the official website (https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Open a terminal window, navigate to the directory where you saved the code and run the command `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Start the app by running the command `npm start`.
4. The app will open and you can interact with the War game by clicking on the play round button and check the state of the game.
